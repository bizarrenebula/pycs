# Console Counter-Strike in Python! 

While going through the design patterns in Python got the idea to implement something like a console version of CS :D 

There'll be a map with given dimensions, a terrorist and a counter-terrorist. 

The terrorist will have a name and bombs
The terrorist will be able to create a bomb by using a bomb class and a bomb manual
The terrorist will be able to plant an available bomb somewhere in the field

# To-do: Create CounterTerrorist.py

The counter-terrorist will be able to search for the bomb in the field
The counter-terrorist will be able to defuse the bomb, if found on time

# To-do: Think about logic for the timing, bomb explosion and bomb defuse
